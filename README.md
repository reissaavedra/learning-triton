# Triton Implementations (WIP)

This project showcases various implementations using Triton, a programming language designed for high-performance computing on GPUs. Below are some examples of how to use Triton for CUDA tensor operations. Please note that this project is a work in progress (WIP) and may undergo changes.

## Examples

### Element-wise Addition of CUDA Tensors

This example demonstrates how to perform element-wise addition of two CUDA tensors using a Triton kernel.
